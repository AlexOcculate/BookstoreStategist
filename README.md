# BookstoreStategist - SwiftCharts Demo Project
This is a demo app that shows book store statitistics with the SwiftCharts API available for iOS 16.
New features for iOS 17 are chart scrolling and chart selection.

There are various chart examples:
- bar charts
- pie charts
- line charts
- scatter plots

## SwiftCharts allows dynamic updating its values
I also added an example where I replace the existing charts data with a new randomly generated data set. You can show the changing to the charts with an animation.
